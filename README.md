File Encryption and Decryption Tool

ðŸ”’ Overview

This project is a simple yet powerful file encryption and decryption tool that secures sensitive data using modern cryptographic techniques. It can encrypt plaintext into ciphertext and decrypt ciphertext back into plaintext. Ideal for securing messages, files, or sensitive information.
âœ¨ Features

  Encryption: Securely encode your data to protect it from unauthorized access.
    Decryption: Decode encrypted data back into its original form.
    Custom Algorithms: Option to switch between encryption methods (e.g., AES).
    User-Friendly: Simple interface and easy-to-integrate codebase.
